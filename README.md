# ActiveStorage::SendZip

Create a zip from one or more Active Storage objects and return it in a rails controller

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_storage-send_zip'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_storage-send_zip

## Usage

Assuming you have an ActiveRecord model with ActiveStorage like this:

~~~ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  has_many_attached :pictures
end
~~~

You simply have to include `ActiveStorage::SendZip` in your controller & use  `ActiveStorage::SendZip#send_zip` method. Just pass some [`ActiveStorage::Attached`](https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveStorage/Attached/) objects as parameters:

~~~ruby
# app/controllers/users_controller.rb
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  include ActiveStorage::SendZip

  # ...

  # GET /users/1
  # GET /users/1.zip
  def show
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html { render }
      format.zip { send_zip @user.pictures }
    end
  end
end
~~~
